image_match is a simple package for finding approximate image matches from a
corpus. It is similar, for instance, to pHash <http://www.phash.org/>, but
includes a database backend that easily scales to billions of images and
supports sustained high rates of image insertion: up to 10,000 images/s on our
cluster!

Based on the paper An image signature for any kind of image, Goldberg et
al <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hcwong/Pdfs/icip02.ps>.
